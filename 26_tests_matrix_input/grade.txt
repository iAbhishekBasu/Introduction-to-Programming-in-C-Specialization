Grading at Thu May 28 13:28:17 UTC 2020
I expected to find a file called 'tests.txt' but it did not exist
(or was not a regular file)
Here are the files that I can find:
grade.txt
input1.txt
input2.txt
input3.txt
input4.txt
input5.txt
input.txt
next-README
README
run_all.sh
Can't proceed without tests.txt

Overall Grade: FAILED
